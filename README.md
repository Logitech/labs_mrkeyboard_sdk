## Introduction
Over the past few months Logitech have been working closely with the Microsoft Mixed Reality team on prototypes of a tracked keyboard for their VR headsets (see [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/vrandmixedrealityheadsets) for list of the HMDs from Samsung, Acer, Lenovo, etc.). The keyboard is tracked using the same mechanism as the Microsoft MR controllers, and you can see the keyboard and your hands in VR.

We’re at a stage now where we’ll be soon sharing some of these prototypes with a small number of external partners under NDA (in July/August). We’ll be sharing code example and built applications, as well as an overlay application that lets you use the keyboard in any SteamVR application.
