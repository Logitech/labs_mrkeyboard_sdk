# MR Keyboard - Browsing Demo
This demo shows an integrated example of the keyboard within a browsing environment. There are two non interactive screens at each side of the browser, to give a taste of what it would be like to work in VR.

## Changelog
* v1.1:
    * Added a text field on the error page to let you try the keyboard out even when internet is down.
* v1.0:
    * Initial release.

## Known issues
When starting the application, due to the inner workings of the Mixed Reality stack, you may need to hit Alt+Tab twice to gain proper focus on the application. A screen within the app indicates when the focus is lost.
